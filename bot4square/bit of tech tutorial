Step 1: Downloading third party libraries
Step 2: Organizing your project structure

Step 3: Adding the shell page:
Step 4: “Booting up” our application
Step 5: Configuring AngularJS Routes
Step 6: Adding our first controller and view

	By looking at the code snippet above you will notice that we used directive called “ng-model”, this directive is responsible for the two-way data binding, in simple words; we’ve bind the text input to the model “exploreNearby” so if the value of the text input has changed, thne the value of the model will be changed and vise verse. Notice how we do not use “$scope” object when we reference the model in the html, using the double curly brackets {{}} is the right way to reference model in the DOM elements i.e. {{exploreNearBy}}.

Step 7: Wiring “FourSquareApp” module to our App



In the next post we’ll start implementing the real business logic in this controller, make RESTful calls to foursquare API using angular services, and project the data in the view in a neat way.









index.html = the “Single Page” which is a container for our application, it will contain the navigation menu and Angular directive for rendering different application views “pages” using JS without the need to download new page from the server (thereby gaining performance because we are not downloading new HTML page each time the user navigating to a new page.) 

After adding the “index.html” page we need to reference the 3rd party JavaScript and CSS files needed as the below:

Step 4: “Booting up” our application

“app.js” =  file is responsible to create modules in applications, in our case we’ll have a single module called “FoursquareApp”, we can consider module as collection of services, directives, filters which is used in the application. Each module has configuration block where it gets applied to the application during the bootstrap process.

Step 5: Configuring AngularJS Routes

Our application will have three different views: (For now you can think about them as pages),

View for displaying search results mapped to route (URL) “/explore“.
View for displaying user bookmarked places mapped to route (URL) ”/places“.
View for about page mapped to route (URL) ”/about“.



Step 7: Wiring “FourSquareApp” module to our App

This is the most forgotten step that usually devs fall into, we need to tell Angular in which part of our application should be active, we can have Mini-SPA i.e. part of the application is SPA and other parts are traditional client/server request. But in our case we want the entire application to use Angular, so the right place to add the directive “ng-app” is on html tag of the shell page “index.html”, it will look at the code snippet below:
