Step 3: Adding the shell page:
Step 4: “Booting up” our application
Step 5: Configuring AngularJS Routes
Step 6: Adding our first controller and view
Step 7: Wiring “FourSquareApp” module to our App












index.html = the “Single Page” which is a container for our application, it will contain the navigation menu and Angular directive for rendering different application views “pages” using JS without the need to download new page from the server (thereby gaining performance because we are not downloading new HTML page each time the user navigating to a new page.) 

After adding the “index.html” page we need to reference the 3rd party JavaScript and CSS files needed as the below:

Step 4: “Booting up” our application

“app.js” =  file is responsible to create modules in applications, in our case we’ll have a single module called “FoursquareApp”, we can consider module as collection of services, directives, filters which is used in the application. Each module has configuration block where it gets applied to the application during the bootstrap process.

Step 5: Configuring AngularJS Routes

Our application will have three different views: (For now you can think about them as pages),

View for displaying search results mapped to route (URL) “/explore“.
View for displaying user bookmarked places mapped to route (URL) ”/places“.
View for about page mapped to route (URL) ”/about“.
